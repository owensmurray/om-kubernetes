# om-kubernetes

This package is deprecated in favor of
[haskell-kubernetes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-kubernetes)
or [kubernetes-client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/kubernetes-client)


It contains some basic functionality, implemented on an as needed basis,
for communicating with the Kubernetes api from within the cluster.
